Do you think I want to make abortions mandatory or something? I'm not pro abortion or anti abortion, there are cases where abortion is a good choice, and cases where it is a bad choice; but regardless of the case, it's not our choice. It's hers.   If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose?   If there were two teams, one was pro-rape and the other was pro-arson, which one would you choose? -_-   Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose?   Neither.   Huh... I guess I could say neither, couldn't I. ;)  It's almost as though I have... a choice. o.O   When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion.

I repress nothing about myself. If I feel like calling you an idiot then I will and if you aren't mature enough to handle such criticism then perhaps your better off banning me.  It would only show your insecurities.   I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent.

What, you want me to re-type EVERYTHING I've written out thus far and highlight everything that qualifies as a fact???  Look, I've debunked you're conclusions. Now you either concede or go about un-debunking me. THAT'S how a debate works. It's not about who has the most facts, it's about who's position makes the most sense.   Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion.   Inconsistent with what? Do you even know what the word inconsistent means? (rhetorical)  Everything you've said so far has been one of the things I asked you to stop doing earlier in this post. They are all fallacies, so yes, your entire argument is based on fallacy. You've even admitted that your arguments are based on appeals to emotion/authority, so I'm not sure exactly what you're complaining about here...

Everyone knows a ""born child"" should not be killed. That is not the issue, it is the cluster of cells within a woman that has no feelings and no personality which is the issue.

I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Nope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   And none of which are usually fatal.   You are attacking another straw man argument. I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong. The point is that if an organism lacks rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciousness, it is no more than a mechanical machine that can be terminated without such an act being considered morally wrong.   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   Did I even make that point?   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.   Right. This is purely an assertion without justification.

You can think what you like, but at 20 weeks' gestation a fetus is still a person. The fact that society may be able to save it without its mother does not automatically make it a person. It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.  .   And about this notion of ""potential life!"" by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout, potentiality is a farce   I don't know where you get your definition, but  until  it has a fully functional, self-sustaining biological system and is not attached to another life via the umbilical cord, I'm going to regard it as potential.  .

So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is ""all"" or ""most"" or even ""vital"" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.

Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me?

He needs a blood transfusion and the mother and child are the same type (the doctor is not).   The doctor explains the risks to the mother - the child needs a lot of blood and he has no way to measure how much is being taken... there is a risk she will loose too much blood and die.  She agrees  He hooks her up, so she is supporting the childs life. After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded, and gets scared. She decides she doesn't want to do this anymore - she has 2 other children at home that need her.  Does she have the right to unhook herself? The child will surely die. Of course she does, it's legal, and nobody has ever tried to make it illegal. Even after agreeing, and being hooked up, she can change her mind.   So if a women gets pregnant, and the fetus is hooked up to her, why does she have to stay hooked up? At some point between her and the fetus the umbilical is part of her body. Does she not have the right to disconnect it if she feels she is not up to going through with it?  Why would a women be legally required to keep her fetus alive by allowing it access to her body, but has no legal requirement that she keep her child alive after it is born (even if there is 0 risk to her life)?

There are good reasons to believe why abortion should only be legal within the first trimester only.   Thats like child abuse.   This is a textbook example of a false analogy. A fetus is not the equivalent of a child.   It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped.   Yes it does. There have been studies of how the children of rape victims are negatively affected in terms of their psychological development, especially if there is a missing parent.   We live in a sexually active society.   We have always lived in a sexually active society. If our society is sexually inactive, the human race would have been extinct by now.   More couples live together today than get married.   I don't see your point. Married couples live together. And you can choose to live together first and get married later.

I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.  About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.  about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.  Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems.

112,"1. At this point in the baby's life, it does. The fetus is an individual human. A fetus is just a term for a body in the womb of a mother.  2. It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother. It is alive and an individual. Again there are people born who are never self-aware, some who never feel, so on your view are they not people? The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival, but so is a newborn, so is an infant, and so is a child. These are all different stages of development of an individual human being. It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life.  3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans. I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings; it gets us nowhere. Let's stick with medical facts.  4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you. In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism, akin to poisoning you to death. Not your nails or hair, but your entire self. If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded, comatose, and senile elderly. Moss and insects are a red herring.  You're getting too emotional with the argument. I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you.

116,"Well we've covered a lot of ground. Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.  What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common? What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together? They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is. You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed. Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function. A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing. Let me explain.  Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Homosexuality: An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.     Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.  Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Do you see the pattern. reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them. At the core of everyone of these is love of self. Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.  Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all? It does me. That's why I oppose all these things.  Final thoughts:  football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game. There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.  Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is. Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with. Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.  Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind.   If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back. Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to. That leads to depression and eventually suicide. That's not a very loving thing to do.  On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do.   About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right. But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?  I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed. After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states. Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it. And that is wrong.  About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about. The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be. Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy.   So again the question on abortion is; what is it? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is adequate.   So I say, it ain't a chicken. Humans produce humans. Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.  Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance.

128,"In Susan Wicklund's book ""this common secret"" about her struggles as an abortion provider, she tells a story of a woman who goes in for an abortion because she believes her abusive husband will kill the baby if she has it. She is turned down, and shortly after the baby is born, she appears at the E.R. with the dead baby. Which is better, Renee, the chance of a baby ACTUALLY being killed, or never being born?  Abortion is NOT child abuse. murder and real abuse is.  people are more likely to abuse a child they don't want right?  Why not give them the chance to not abuse a child at all?

131,"I do not see it as acceptable except in extreme health cases. The reason for this is that a fetus is a human life form, and abortion is either murder or stopping a human life from becoming fully developed into a person. I'm not saying it's not a difficult issue, or that other viewpoints are invalid, of course. It's just the way I see it, and it makes sense to me logically. Is even the case of rape a reason to kill a human life? Perhaps, if it is before the fetus gains a consciousness. But if you are killing a conscious human being, I can't see even the case of rape justifying that.   Now, I do not know at what point during pregnancy, or after, a child/fetus has consciousness. If anyone knows this(and can back it up with a reliable source), by all means, tell me. I'm not saying that the knowledge(even if it says the fetus does not have consciousness) would definitely change my viewpoint, but it could.  At any rate, I don't think that abortion without good reason would be okay, because whether or not a fetus is a person, it is a developing human life.   So...go on. Tear me apart.

134,"""Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,"" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.""  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   ""The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists""  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  ""no law respecting an establishment of religion""  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that ""other"" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future.

136,"I am just going to repeat what I said before in different terms because I am not sure how I can make it any more clear.  A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. This is not the case with an inviable fetus.

139,"This is a speech that i found:  On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.  Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.  Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.  The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.  Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.  The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.  In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.

140,"I am quite sick of abortion debates, so I'll write my three strongest arguments for abortion and let's see if any of you ""pro-life"" people can rebut them. While many people have formulated different arguments for abortion (some better than others), not all of them are grounded in the concept of  sentience . Unlike them, all of my three arguments do, at least, relate to the concept of sentience.   1. The Sentience Argument   1. Only a being that is conscious and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain can be said to have interests.  2. A sentient, and therefore morally significant, being is one with an interest in continued life.  3. Ergo, only a sentient being can be said to perhaps have a  right  to life. (From (2) )  4. Normal human foetus begins to possess a rudimentary capacity for sentience in the  second  trimester.  5. Ergo, an early term foetus is  NOT  a being with an interest in its own continued life. (From (3) and (4) ) (Or, Only a human foetus from the second trimester on can perhaps be said to have a right to life)  6. Ergo, an early term human foetus (i.e. foetus in the first trimester) does  not  have a right to life (from (5) )  7. Ergo, an early term abortion is morally permissible (from (6) ).   2. The Utilitarian Argument   1. Different sentient beings experience differing degrees or intensities of experiences such as suffering.  2. The prospect of death and dying is a more intense experience for a sentient being that possesses capabilities such as foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  3. Ergo, the principle of respect for the interests of sentient beings does not imply that all sentient beings have an equal right to life. (from (1) and (2) )  4. A foetus, sentient or otherwise, does not possess foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  5. Ergo, a sentient foetus may be accorded lesser moral significance than the sentient adult human being in whose body it gestates. (from (3) and (4) )  6. Ergo, the suffering experienced by a sentient late term foetus terminated through abortion, would be less than the suffering experienced by the pregnant woman, a sentient being, were she forced to continue with the pregnancy. (from (1), (2) and (4) )  7. Ergo, a sentient pregnant woman has a greater right to life than a (sentient) foetus. (from (3) and (6) )  8. Ergo, a late term abortion is morally permissible (from (7) )   3. The Personhood Argument   1. Personhood is defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.  2. It is more seriously morally impermissible to kill a person than a non-person, even a sentient non-person.  3. An early-stage foetus possesses little, if anything, in the way of consciousness, self-conceptualisation, reasoning and communication abilities.  4. Ergo, focuses are not persons (from (1) and (3) )  5. Ergo, foetuses cannot possess interests or rights, including the right to life (from (4) )  6. Ergo, it is not morally impermissible to kill them (from (5) ).  You might have noticed that in all three of my arguments, my conclusions are not necessarily the same. I am  not  advocating for a convergence in conclusion when I posit these arguments. I am merely stating three (quite) good arguments for abortion.

144,"Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it. The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers. Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate. I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like  Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged  it makes it really difficult to continue.  Of course no one wants to get an abortion. Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something. What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes. Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions). I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.  I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother. We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.

149,"I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?   I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   Would you still laugh if the orchestrator of the largest genocide in history were to be aborted?

I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy. If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that? I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice.  At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask? Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)?  My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating. If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet? We would be in a massive state of poverty, much more drastic than we see now.

If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done.

When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.

Government cannot imagine every potential abortion scenario and in a free country is not the one that should make those decisions.  Keep up the good work.

I saw an awful interview with a woman who ""survived abortion"" during the seventh month of her mothers pregnancy. She of course is now a pro lifer and spews misinformation about Obama being a baby killer. Nowadays abortions are not typically done at that point of a pregnancy. If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator, there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby. A child changes the lives of many people involved. If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all. We're there medically. If, according to an above poster, it is the woman's fault, then it of course is also the woman's choice.

168,"Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.   I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion.   According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.    I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in  literally  every post since the issue came up. If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.   Abortion is legal.  Murder is not legal.  Therefor, legally, abortion cannot be murder.   And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus.    I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability.    Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.   Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you. An aborted fetus is equally incapable of developing into a human.

169,"The life of a fetus should have as much value as any other human life.   it is generally accepted that people can kill in self-defense with varying levels of imminent harm as justification - if you apply that same principle to the mother fetus relationship that would permit abortions with varying degrees of danger to life and health of the mother.

""So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?""

You make me out to be some serial killer yet you don't expound on how the reason behind it is flawed, you only call me evil and insult my beliefs and party.   ""You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?""   Yes if a defect is detected during pregnancy. Now I am not saying they have to, I am saying that if it was up to me I would choose an abortion, and if you believe that is wrong due to your close minded perception of morality, then that is of no consequence to me. You are trying to run a perceptive analytical argument and it is frustrating me because my source of these views is based on that of a separate pattern of thinking, I am coming from a place of thought and logic, you are coming form a place born from what you perceive to be ""right"" or ""moral"" when in fact you have little to no understanding of the impacts such thinking has had on society and yet you call me a danger.

In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort? If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it, he's like all powerful or something right? He doesn't need your help asshole.  4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening.  5. Making abortions illegal has been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths.

However waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification.

Declaring it to be something else and equivocating on terms may salve your conscience but it doesn't change the reality of what it is.

173,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life. Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?

176,"Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life. When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked."" Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib? Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds. Even if you don't believe abortion is murder, it still demeans the value of human life, since women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.  Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control. There are dozens of birth control methods that can keep you from becoming pregnant, including the 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.  The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out. What would the world be like if the mothers of Abe Lincoln, George Washington, or Thomas Edison had had an abortion? Just maybe a woman has become pregnant despite all birth control attempts because the child is destined to do something great.  Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child. Many women who have abortion in their younger years end up living the rest of their lives in perpetual guilt. Even if that women doesn't consider it murder at the time, that may change as she matures. Even Jane Roe (not her real name), the original woman behind the famous court decision, has completely changed her mind on abortion. She filed a petition to have the decision overturned to help relieve the guilt of hundreds of thousands of needless deaths she blames on herself. Also, let's not forget that there are two parents of every aborted child. The father may feel just as guilty. The father may even want the child, but he has no choice if the mother chooses abortion.  The advances of genetic testing may prompt more abortions (to avoid having the non-ideal child). All of us who have or want kids imagine them growing up to be doctors, senators, sports stars, or whatever. But what would you do if you knew the child would have Down's Syndrome? What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? What if the child had a strong risk of schizophrenia? Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion? As genetic knowledge continues to grow, we are able to determine more and more about what a child will be like as an adult. Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.  There are many couples who spend years on waiting lists trying to adopt a child. The number of couples out there who cannot have a child of their own for physical reasons are too numerous to count. The waiting list for adopting babies can be 5-10 years or more. Young women in their teens are right to be concerned that they're not ready to effectively raise a child. However, if that is the case, there are plenty of wonderful people out there who are. Not only would you be bringing a valuable life into the world, you'd also be making the dream of a childless couple come true.  The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults, who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions. There's a good reason why we don't allow people to drink alcohol, smoke, or drive until they're a certain age. It's because they haven't matured enough to make good, sound decisions. We've all made bad decisions in our younger years that provide us with life experience to make sounder judgment in the future. The one skill that seems to take the longest time to develop is the ability to consider the feelings and needs of someone besides ourselves. Why should such a life or death decision as abortion be made by a person who probably hasn't developed that capacity?   People have the right not to see their tax dollars go to something they find immoral. Abortion is a medical procedure that must be performed by a doctor. The government contributes to many health care institutions such as Healthcare for the Homeless, Planned Parenthood, free clinics, etc. All of us who pay taxes have the right to prevent that money from going to something we consider murder.   Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child. The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen. Just because the babies can't speak for themselves doesn't mean they have no rights. If a 1-month old is murdered, it that really different than abortion as far as protecting an American's life? If a person shoots and kills a pregnant woman, shouldn't the punishment be more severe? If you legalize abortion, it would tell the courts there is no difference.   Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility. Abortion exposes woman to a number of health risks including, but not limited to, infection, sterility, and in rare cases, death. A number of short-term symptoms such as bleeding, fever, nausea, and vomiting are also common.   Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath. Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"". It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed. Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism. Killing a human being doesn't serve any higher medical purpose and is therefore a violation of the oath.

177,"You are correct in your assessment of me. Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there.   I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast. Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.  But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound? If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved. And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost. If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me.  “If you love Me, keep My commandments"" John 14:15   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know.

A one, two, three, etc. month old fetus isn't thinking  anything , much less babbling to itself about how much it loves its mommy.

Maybe not to the same extent as, say, scraping the inside of your cheek or scratching a layer of epidermis with your fingernails, but they lack any human fetus or vertebrae features until well into 3 months of development. Otherwise, what you'd see under a microscope really would just be unremarkable ""cell"" reproduction.     I'm sure what Hollow more accurately meant to say was ""blastocyst,"" which is really just a scientific term for the pre-fetus stage of conception in which the developing embryo really IS just a clump of cells that begin reproducing after the fertilized ovum has attached itself to the uteran wall. For the technical definition, see:  Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.  (http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=18258)   And if you're confused by what an ""embryo"" is:  A human embryo is a discrete entity that has arisen from either: the first mitotic division when fertilization of a human oocyte by a human sperm is complete or any other process that initiates organized development of a biological entity with a human nuclear genome or altered human nuclear genome that has the potential to develop up to, or beyond, the stage at which the primitive streak appears, and has not yet reached 8 weeks of development since the first mitotic division.

This is because the fetus doesnt develp consciousness until the onset of the third trimester - prior to this point (more than ~99% of all abortions occure in the 1st trimester) there is no moral status to the actions taken with regards to the preservation of the fetus. This is true for surgical abortions too since they also occure during the first trimester.   The morality of abortion has to do with the freedom to have them, not the act of doing them, since the act of doing them is for all reasonable accounts an a-moral action. It should be everyone's right to have an abortion because people should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.

257,"It is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -""if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents."" - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.

The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i.e. not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic.   There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.

In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children. In that sense, it is naturally wrong. In another sense, it is right to be homosexuals because you can stop overpopulation. These are two contradicting statements showed by ReventonRage and RiceD. However, these statements are truthful in their own perspective. I understand that homosexuals can't have kids. They can adopt children and thus, support the advancement of the human race. Homosexuals, like non-homosexuals, can become scientists and mathmaticians that supports the advancment of the human race. Im just providing more senses in which being a homosexual is right.

First: Marriage is, in all of the truest sense, a contract between two individuals. A legal document does not ensure that the agreement will be forever upheld. People fall out of love all of the time. Why does sexual orientation, in the land of the free, change the definition of a contract? Marriage is a contract; why else would the courts be bogged down by disputes of property, wealth, and future holdings?  Second: When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners? We, in the U.S.A. look away when companies contract each other to form conglomerates. Why do we care so much about people in love that we would show our prejudices?  Third: The human spirit should be without bonds. Let individuals be individuals. An atmosphere of growth will yield much more than the atmosphere of ""let's wait and see"".

115,"Wow, you are a chore.  I am calling you closed minded. You have to be willing to attempt to see the issue from the other person's point of view. I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin."" I'm a really good person, in fact. So to me, it feels like people want LGBT people to be all sinning and rebels and haters. No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads. The sinners are those hot Catholic school girls who take their shirts off for girls gone wild the second they get out of the house. In fact, that is what's wrong with the white picket fence scenario. It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.  By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State.

I have three points:  Point one: I am a purist and I want the word 'marriage' to mean exactly what those who invented the word years ago defined it to be, ""A civil union between a man and a woman."" I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals.""     Point two: Just because someone wants something doesn't mean that they are entitled to it. So, no matter how noble gays may be, no matter how important the word is to them, they are not entitled to it.  Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word. But trying to force someone into doing something they don't want usually results in them resisting with equal or greater force.  I thus propose that gays create a new word and stop this ""war.""

There is no difference between the two in Physics either.   But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   Look.

Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you?

If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.

Hopefully you read this Jake.  gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would  choose  to be gay instead of heterosexual.  that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.  ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?  I know for myself, being very comfortable in my heterosexuality, I would not magically  turn  gay because a law was passed.   do you fear, jake, that you may magically  turn  gay if a law were passed?  because that is really the only reason for your statement. if you actually think about what your wrote, I mean, that's the only possible end conclusion.  and if you do stand behind that statement jake, I have to ask myself, what kind of person would have such a ridiculous fear.  and I can only think of one kind jake. a closet gay person.  so if you want to come out, which I'm assuming from your statement deep down you do, then this is the place for it.

So their chance of having a child are small, if not impossible.   Unmarried people can adopt, at least in the UK and US, but google tells me it makes the process a little easier, so that's a good point that I hadn't considered.  Depends. Two men kissing is fine but I wouldn't really want to see them getting up to their private business. With women, I'd be quite happy to watch that all day.

Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8."" I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.  And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.   ""What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority.""   You mean, just like interracial marriage?

173,"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas.   As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.  Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.  Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.  In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.  Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights.   No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.  I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots.

An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them.

There are legitimate legal rights and privileges granted to married couples by government, and there is no secular reason to deny them these rights based on their sexuality.

Don't get me wrong, it has points that many make but there are plenty of studies out there that will put you at ease.  First, I would recommend you do a little research on childhood psychology.   Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad.   Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed.   One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School). Growing up in a small town almost entirely made up of white republican Catholics, I was abnormal; I knew I was different. Guess what, I'm doing just fine. And I'm not overweight and proud of my dual nationality. If anything it brought about a better sense of self.

It also determines when mechanical plants are to be changed, unearths systematic errors and blunders. Of special concern are systematic errors, which are frequently caused by miscalibration. This error in a system also produces normal curve, but skewed. Thus, shifting the goal post thereby making previously deviance behaviour acceptable. That’s why you (ChadOnSunday221) can no longer see that gay marriages are immoral and unethical; it was a slide of hands.

I in point of fact know a very nice and happy gay man, who was once engaged and has told me to my face that he was a happy straight man, did some experimentation, found someone he really liked who was a man and made a choice to live a gay lifestyle. He said he was happy either way, but thinks this is what makes him happiest.  I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't. And after reading more of the responses on here it just gets back to this absurd point that those of us who are ""opposed"", and I use this term loosely because to tell you the truth, until the prop 8 fiasco in which the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me I honestly didn't give a damn, to gay marriage are hated, disposed, called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.  The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons.

It's common to see girls and boys hanging out together but not boys and boys hugging each other touching here an there.  Kids learn from their parents and it's monkey see monkey do. When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.  Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.  It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.  What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.  Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions. I personally abhor christianity because of its contradictions and it's violation of karma.  One quote i recieved from my friend who is a christian. He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.  'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.  This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.  And god don't love us too.  If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.  And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.  Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.

Don't recognize a person's right to tell you ""no."" If you stand there and argue with that person, then you have just recognized their right to tell you ""no"" and you are now trying to change their their mind to say ""yes"" so that they let you do whatever it is you want to do.   Basically what I'm saying is that the way gays have been going about fighting for their rights recognizes the opposition's right to say ""no.""  Now, I agree with and support this:  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.  I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on and they will therefore fight back. In other words, it legitimizes their right to oppose same sex marriage and gives them reason to fight back.  I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights. The federal government has way too much power.  Now, I did not say that gays are unreasonable for wanting same sex marriage. I am saying that if they are trying to follow scenarios one and two above, they are being unreasonable in the way they are pursuing it.   The argument that ""it doesn't affect any straight couple"" doesn't work because anyone could say, ""And? So what? Who cares? The majority has voted. They don't want it!""  The whole ""African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted"" doesn't work because the word marriage has a religious aspect to it that needs to be separated from the legal aspect. If it can't be removed, then another word needs to take its place.  You ask, ""What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?"" The answer is: Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so. By arguing the point you are admitting/recognizing their right to oppose you. If your stance is that they have no right to oppose you, then you need not argue the point; you just figure a way to navigate the system or go around the system.  Now, lets see how ridiculous you sound when you say that gays have never been able to find an ounce of happiness because they don't have a piece of paper that says that they are legally married. What a bunch of crap. Do you actually expect me to believe that a piece of paper is going to magically make them find happiness? Come on.  Gays have been living together, spending the rest of their lives together, loving each other, expressing their love for each other in front of friends and family for ages. If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again. Those people who hate gays will always hate gays regardless of this piece of paper you so desperately want.

However, you can accept the behavior without condoning it and this is what America is saying.

212,"In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when it’s two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.    You claim that my argument, ‘fail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation.   You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.  Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question.   Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.  Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt.   Argument is both invalid and fallacious.  Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious)   Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)  There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.  They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.    I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false.

I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.

I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  ""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  ""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""  I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)

""Gay and lesbian parents are well aware of the difficulties that a child may face - many have dealt with prejudice all of their lives. Most see it as an opportunity for ongoing discussion that will help their children grow as people.""  According to studies, ""Wendell Ricketts and Roberta Achtenberg, in the article ""Adoption and Foster Parenting for Lesbians and Gay Men: Creating New Traditions in Family"" from Homosexuality and Family Relations, address social workers grappling with the issue by asking, ""...should children be sheltered from every experience in which their difference might challenge prejudice, ignorance, or the status quo (or in which they would be 'exposed' to the difference of others)? Agencies conforming to such a standard must ask themselves whether it is their function to honor the system that generates stigma by upholding its constraints."" They continue, ""Teasing is what children do. Does this mean that child welfare policy must be set at a level no higher than the social interactions of children?""  ""The bulk of evidence to date indicates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to become homosexual than children raised by heterosexuals. As one researcher put it, ""If heterosexual parenting is insufficient to ensure that children will also be heterosexual, then there is no reason to conclude that children of homosexuals also will be gay"". 11  ""Studies asking the children of gay fathers to express their sexual orientation showed the majority of children to be heterosexual, with the proportion of gay offspring similar to that of a random sample of the population. An assessment of more than 300 children born to gay or lesbian parents in 12 different samples shows no evidence of ""significant disturbances of any kind in the development of sexual identity among these individuals"". 12   ""Courts have expressed concern that children raised by gay and lesbian parents may have difficulties with their personal and psychological development, self-esteem, and social and peer relationships. Because of this concern, researchers have focused on children's development in gay and lesbian families.  The studies conclude that children of gay or lesbian parents are no different than their counterparts raised by heterosexual parents. In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""  Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation. A parent's capacity to be respectful and supportive of the child's autonomy and to maintain her own intimate attachments, far outweighs the influence of the parent's sexual orientation alone.""

260,"""If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""   I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.  Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.  Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.  This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.  I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene.   The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool.

279,"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :  In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution   I suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.  The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.  My response:  Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.  If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.  We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual?   The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:  The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.   Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.    If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.    I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.)   Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.  One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.

290,"All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females.   In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.  Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.

297,"No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.    Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds.   Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.    And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny.

From my experience, they escalate from one drug to another in a very short time.   The people I'm talking about cutting off from the dealer are the ones who just want to relax on pot for a while, and have no real intention of ever turning to anything heavier. The ones who it takes a lot to get them to try anything new. The ones who after months and months of ""Just try it, on the house, no worries,"" finally give in thinking ""Just once."" That's how my ex started on speed. For years he had smoked pot, saying that doing anything else was a fool's game. But all his ""mates"" (i.e. his dealer and the guys he hung out with while he was at his dealer's house) were doing it, and they were all egging him on. So the first time, he tried it at a quarter dose. But he refused to inject it. He was adamant about that. He dropped balls... meaning he swallowed small amounts of speed wrapped up in cigarette papers. For about a year he tried it off and on, which was enough time for him to get well and truly hooked on it. At which point he started injecting it. I left him soon after. He's gone on to do pretty much everything since, and last I heard he was on the methadone program.  If pot had been available over the counter, I doubt that his habit would have escalated beyond pot. He would simply have been too lazy to go and find someone to sell him something illegal.

The ""one step over the line, it's hardly anything"" lead to ""one more step"" leads to ""one more step"", and before you know it the line is so far back that you can't see your starting position any more.   He didn't start using pot because he wanted to be high. He started using it to fit in with a crowd of people. He was very susceptible to peer pressure. That's the reason he went on to other drugs. He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be ""friends"" with his dealer. So yes, it was his fault, because if he hadn't been such a weak assed spineless wimp of a man he would have stuck by his guns. But if he'd been able to obtain marijuana over the counter, he wouldn't have needed that link to the dealer.

If made legal, it will become a competitive market just like any other thing. (At least for those who don't grow it). That would mean there would still be [illegal] sellers, as they would be breeding more powerful strains to get more powerful amount of THC levels.   The more powerful it is the more addicting. Substance abuse is a health problem. We already have a huge health-care industry centered around alcohol/drug abuse. You want to add to the list?   The Tobacco Companies wait in anticipation so they can start packaging and selling to more idiots. That's right--I'm talking marijuana. No doubt they pay for studies to try to prove that marijuana is ""harmless"". They see big dollar signs, just like with tobacco.  The FDA would have to get involved to ""put a limit"" on ""acceptable"" drug levels. They would also have to enforce these rules, And just like with alcohol, they have to watch for ""bootleg"" sellers who try to sell dangerous products.

And this wouldn't stop drug lords, do they not have cigarettes on the black market at dirt cheap prices? Wouldn't you buy from someone growing themselves at a cheaper price to avoid a tax? How does that stimulate a business let alone the whole economy?  4. The last thing we need is more people doing it. More people making it a problem for themselves, more people ending up in rehab at the governments expense. In fact I hate being around people doing it.

I'm tired of hearing about nice people who are doing 10 years to life just for weed.

87,"""That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this.""   I completely disagree with this statement and it goes against any scientific proof. Studies have been done that prove if you take breaks and have more leisure time you are a much more effective worker. Now obviously if you are neglecting your responsibilities leisure is bad. But that in no way implies that you have to be always working.  In your next response you talk about how you morally think doing things that are unproductive or enjoyable are wrong. I have several problems with this. First off, honestly I'm not you and neither is anyone else why should we have to be held accountable to your unreasonable and arbitrary morals. Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy people are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect people to operate without leisure time.  If you are going to tell people whether they can or cannot use substances such as Cannabis; than at least have a better reason than your supposed morals that almost half the country disagrees with. You admit to being hypocritical about your no-leisure rule by being on the internet rather than doing something productive and who is to say that is all your hypocritical about. So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals.  But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through illegal channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a legal substance (Alcohol) in my spare time. Decriminalization is not enough. The game is over, we know that Cannabis is no worse and possibly better than Alcohol and denying people the right to a trustworthy and accountable Cannabis industry is authoritarian at best.

Where's the evidence to back this up?  Pot is not physically addicting. However, caffeine, is addictive.

92,"The War on Drugs is not only a moral problem but a economic problem. First, it is morally wrong because the government restricts the free choice of individuals to participate in such substances, and the number of people people killed every year with selling or buying drugs is simply unnecessary and unjust. When someone engages in the use of drugs, it is the decision of that person and they are only hurting themselves nor the government.  Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well. The government would have 10 billion dollars to spend elsewhere. It would eliminate drug cartels. Not only is the enforcement costly, but by criminalizing these people, taxpayers have to pay for them in live in prisons throughout America.

More than that, tens of thousands of people die every year from lung cancer and alcohol related accidents and illnesses. If your an alcoholic you can die if you just stop drinking. No one to my knowledge has ever been killed from smoking or quiting cannabis. In addition, cannabis has not been shown to have the carcinogenic effects that tobacco has. Cannabis has even been shown to promote new brain cell development, and its users report wide ranging benefits.

100,"I think the biggest reason that marijuana is illegal is a cultural one. If you've never smoked it, it's hard to describe how it makes you feel. The best way I can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. It slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. This leads me to my next part. It's going to require a leap, so follow me. The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, ""Do I really need that many THINGS?"", ""Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a ""boss""?"" ""Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?"" ""Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?""  There are other reasons that marijuana should be legal or at least decriminalized, but I believe this is the biggest obstacle: We might actually wake up and analyze what our lives are, what consequences our behaviors have on ourselves, our neighbors, and the rest of the world. We might stop consuming.

This argument is subjective to individual experince; therefore it cannot be used to support the prohibition of marijuana because there is more smokers who have not tried harder drugs than there is smokers who have. #2 - This claim never existed until after 9-11 happened and governmental scare tactics used on the population to further it's own agenda. If anyone knows drugs and their nature, they'd know that marijuana money is chump change to harder, more expensive drugs. If a terrorist organization were to make money from the export of illegal drugs, they are more likely to sell cocaine, heroin, and/or MDMA (Ecstasy).

113,"What is truly pitiful is that one could find pity and fear in what you do not know. I use your post as supporting evidence.    Now, if you're realistically thinking about this issue, and not in Imagination Land, you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity. I am a citizen of these United States of America, and I know what that means.   I personally have no concern about the drug itself and I am fully aware that cigarettes and alcohol are more dangerous, but legal.   When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine for the few drugs on the market that marijuana could (realistically) replace. Also, I actually advocate the use of hemp and wish America would get with the program, I know the benefits of hemp cloths and hemp oils.   What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.    If you look at society as a whole, we already have a few cancers at work. Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug. Cigarettes, for the economy are bad, because those who smoke are hopelessly addicted and will spend money on cigarettes before spending it on things that they should buy, like food or clothes. Do we really, at this point need another? For people who don't drink, and for people who don't smoke cigarettes?   Like I said, think about it realistically. What is government for? Why is a government needed at all, I mean, what is the main single duty of a government???  It is to secure domestic peace , before anything else, that is what a government does. The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace. If someone steps out of line, because they have agreed to live under this government, are held to the same rules as the next. No one steps out of line, and we have a perfectly paired society to it's government. Unfortunately we, as humans, cannot have this.    So if the government only really exists to secure domestic peace, yet we already have a number of drugs out there, why should we have another to complicate things with.    Also, you have to imagine that weed is legal. No more will people feel the need to be home when stoned. They might as well get stoned in public. Like drinking, especially if it were made illegal, people would take their beer home with them, and drink there, most people  do , stay home and drink. If it were illegal, you wouldn't see drunk people as much now would you? I highly doubt you would.    Marijuana, I logically think, would be more addicting than tobacco and alcohol combined if it were made legal and then integrated into popular culture, as tobacco is. You get more for less, with less consequences... what a dream, right? I mean, if I am opposed to the legalization, yet I would still do it if it were, doesn't that mean something???   It's something that I don't want to deal with, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on this. If it were legalized, it would only get worse.    That's really all I can say for now, and sorry if it wasn't enough to satisfy your lack of understanding.    I would like to advise you that ad hominen arguments are not welcome here.      You are on a website that allows you to share ideas and opinions. Do not attack people for their opinions because, if you think that denying the legalization of marijuana is not American, you are doing the greater evil by suppressing the voices of the citizens that this democracy represents by using childish and petty insults.

114,"I don't think that it should be legalized but at the same time I think that it should be decriminalized.    The drug, or all drugs for that matter, have an effect on society. It's not just about the individuals safety. We already have tobacco and alcohol, if we make either illegal there will be a riot, jobs will be lost and so on. If we add another drug to the legal market, that's just another way to waste time.    People in this country act like everyone owes them something, like their 8 hour shift at work is all that is expected of them and that's all that they have to do. Anything more is a waste of their time because they could be spending it doing something that they want to do. Sure, that's the American dream. Work, go home and plan your next vacation, maybe sit back and relax with a beer. Watch television and talk about the ""good ol times"" with your buddy... That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this (I'm using cognitive processes to contribute to an idea that other people can read, appreciate, or better, disagree with, so technically neither you nor I are really wasting time, but you and I could be doing better).

Whether it is more or less harmful than other legal drugs doesn't make a difference. It is illegal because of the negative effects it has on your body. To argue that, ""that isn't fair because alcohol and tobacco"" is stupid to say. My reasoning behind this is that alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because to try to make something illegal that has been legal for so long is nearly impossible. Back when America passed the prohibition laws, they didn't stop anyone from smuggling alcohol into the country. In fact, crime rates went up and eventually they had to re-legalize it.

122,"The answer to the question, does marijuana effect the brain? Marijuana does not effect the brain in damage, but it can alter in functions. Marijuana effects the perception of time, distance, and speed. It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ""Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness."" So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, ""depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy."" 123helpme.com  This make you want to smoke mary? :) cus it certainly doesnt apeal to me.

A question of legality should be totally devoid of any of the the potential benefits or problems since our political system is not based upon paternal justifications.  This aside, the overwhelming benefits to society is enough even for a clearly paternal government to legalise.

127,"The argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed. Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol.  Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves. That isn't even touching on the other benefits of legalisation, including freeing up space in the over-crowded prison system, providing an additional source of government income in the form of tax and freeing up police time to tackle violent crimes.

Among working adults, marijuana users tend to earn higher wages than non-users. College students who use marijuana have the same grades as nonusers. Among high school students, heavy use is associated with school failure, but school failure usually comes first.

Sin embargo, esto no la hace menos dañina, solamente menos atractiva. Pero si hay estudios que indican que la mariguana no es tan dañina como se dice, entonces el hecho de que sea legal solamente causaría un daño en su adicción, lo cual se podría manejar subiéndole el precio o creando leyes que regulen y desinsentiven su consumo.

137,"Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.

To illustrate - A few years ago I wrote a story about an alien civilization acting as if they were about to exterminate all humans, the aliens announced it on the news so a global panic was achieved, and nothing really happened, only that a feeling of survivalism boiled up everywhere, there was a greater power threatening from above, one intention over everyone, seeing all human kind as unified, ignoring our differences and difficulties with each other.

87,"Uh...The ""Bush"" bailout of the banks was done at the request of then president-elect Obama.   That's not even what the article reports. The article pertains to a potential (at the time) Obama request for additional funds not already released in the Bailout process (that was allocated in the Bailout). The Bailout had already been put into action and wasn't done at the request of Obama. You're interpretation is wrong.   The GM was paid back?!   Yes. GM ultimately used their loaned money to repay their loan. Get the fuck over it. The next time you take out a loan and realize you don't have to use all of it, make sure to never - ever - use any of the residual to help pay back your loan. There's something wrong with that, according to you.   The taxpayer isn't getting jack shit paid back.   My assertion was that taxpayer money was returned, not that it was being returned to the taxpayer. We let go of that money. It's not ""ours"" anymore, it's money that is to be used by the government.   The only thing we'll be getting is inflation, higher taxes, and raised insurance premiums thanks to healthcare ""deform.""   Okay.
",1,1,Barack Obama
88,"Exactly! So why did he promise he'd get them out? It doesn't matter how far fetched his promises were, the fact that he couldn't keep them is the problem.   Obama was hoping, perhaps naively, that Iraq would have been stabilized by now and could run without our assistance. From the very beginning up until right now we have always underestimated the sheer determination of the force we are fighting against. Obama believed that we would have made much more progress in the conflict than we have, and we could leave safely.   Then why even waste so much on it? If it cost so much and had only a small effect then wouldn't it have been better without it? Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending? Why does it seem like he thinks that MORE spending will help the economy?    This is the reason why economics is so confusing for so many people. You CAN help an economy with spending more. Sounds crazy but it is possible. The cost isn't what's important, what's important is:  1) Where is the money going.  2) What is it doing once it gets there.  The idea is this. If the government gives us money, the hope is that we will spend it on goods and services and in return generate revenue, this revenue becomes income. This income is then spent on more goods and services, which will generate more revenue and so forth... So by encouraging people to spend money in exchange for goods and services, Obama was hoping to improve the economy.   The more money changes hands the better the economy will be. So by spending money, we are causing it to change hands.  An increase in spending has two benefits:  -increased economic activity for us  -increased tax revenue for the government.  It's a win-win situation. What often happens is that people get their stimulus check, and then they put it in their savings account where it sits. The money doesn't do the economy any good if it just sits in your bank account. People have to spend their stimulus checks for it to help the economy any. Another thing that happens is people get their stimulus checks they spend their money on some name-brand good and the money goes directly into the bank account of some rich CEO where it can sit for years before it is ever spent again.

The rest was purchased shares, if I remember correctly, and wasn't a loan - but carried an expectation of being bought back by GM or some other investor. They used the escrow funds to repay their outstanding balance. I grant you full justification for complaining about the money going to  any company  to begin with. That's fine.

Let me restate that in actuality Bush's response was worse then Obama's, Bush was told by the Govenor of Louisana as well as the Mayor of New Orleans that the leevees would not hold prior to Katrina but did nothing, it hit New Orleans on Monday and Bush overflew the devastated area on Air Force One as he traveled from Texas back to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and wasn't briefed about the situation until he arrived at the Gulf Coast on Friday. Thats a week of doing nothing even though he had already been told prior to Katrina that the leevees would not hold.  The oil spill that is occuring right now however was not predicted and Obama was told by BP that it was not a serious problem and wasn't told that the leak was in fact serious until almost a week later.

""Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him.""

In 2012, it is about how the Republican Party has acted so poorly over the last year most recently and continually with the budget then add in the total lack of viable Republican candidates. Ron Paul is about the only one who has enough to say that it is worth listening to. (whether you agree or not). I am a liberal Republican and looking at this election, the Republican party might as well place a loaded trash bag in a suit and call it a candidate. Sad but true.

When Obama took office we were losing on average 700,000 jobs per month. Now we've leveled off gaining some and losing some month to month. The reason Obama has not done as much as he wanted is because since he took office Republicans have raped the filibuster rule. Prior to Obama being president the most any party had used the filibuster in the history of the Senate in one year was around a hundred. Last year Republicans filibustered over 200 times. That is the only reason he hasn't had as much as he would like done. That's not his fault.  And every president since Nixon except Bush Jr has wanted to pass a healthcare bill. Every single one. Obama has been the only President able to, and that in itself is going to put him on par with some great presidents. And once this psychotic tea party pout fest ends and republicans come to their senses and start compromising on things, he'll be able to bring the economy the rest of the way back as well.  Of course though in 6 years Republicans will just elect another frat boy or actor to ruin all the hard democratic work again &gt;&lt;

On the other hand I had a real new rule regulation hit me in the face to day. I was trying to surrender and pull my money out of a 403B plan that my wife has and before Jan 1 of this year it would have been no problem but now you can't. The reason when I asked my broker was they had no reason even when the regulators set out the new rules they targeted 403B and their reason according to my broker who is an expert on the markets said they had none. Great! So this is the great regulation we where all waiting for not allowing people to get their own money out. This just happened to me today. There's a lot more to the story but it is so frustrating that I will get even more mad. Basically the new regulation is a form of pure Socialism. My money, won't let me have it. I have to make up some lie just to get it out like I'm sick or something or I have a hardship which I don't but that's besides the point. I don't know if you own a home or business but if you did you would see the huge amount of more taxes you pay just to own a home or business it's stifling. The argument here is that the more taxes and more government regulation the less freedoms we have and less individual drive we have.

133,"""they will probably lose everything in the next two elections.""  I think that people still aren't over all of Bush's fuck ups yet so there probably won't be a huge change to support for Republicans. They had that special election in Pa. was won by a Democrat a couple days ago so I think that this next election could really go either way for the Democrats. I think that everyone is just tired of the establishment and wants to get rid of the incumbents. So I guess since Dems have a majority, they are the bigger target but the fact the people are still pissed at Bush, balances out both parties chances of victory. Atleast thats how I feel.

It doesn't matter how far fetched his promises were, the fact that he couldn't keep them is the problem.   The same reason band-aids don't heal bullet wounds. The bailout was only slightly lessened the affects of this economic downturn. It doesn't alleviate or address the root of the problem.   Then why even waste so much on it? If it cost so much and had only a small effect then wouldn't it have been better without it?   Because we're spending trillions of dollars on a war with no end in sight, and the housing bubble collapsed along with our domestic automotive industry. Did you know Bush was the only president in history to cut taxes during a time of war? Where were his financial advisers when that decision was made? We're going further into debt because we're spending as much as we ever have and yet we don't have the resources to back up our spending.   Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending?

Took way to long to present his birth certificate…if that is the real we probably will never know. Never would present his academic records from the colleges he supposedly attended. Would not release his medical records either. Who is he?  Well he has bowed down and kissed Arab leaders. He has treated the president of Israel terrible…what leader in the world comes to the White House and has to use the back door?   His hero is an anti-American racist who hates whites….Rev. Wright. He was in bed with Tony Rezko the Chicgo slug who is now in prison. I mean what political candidate would take money from someone who is being investigated by the FBI? OBAMA.  Then there is his affiliation to communist radicals…many of whom he appointed as Czars in his administration. Enter the scene….Bernadine Dohrn and her communist husband Bill Ayers who founded the organization Weather Underground.    ""The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [Black] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement."" And that is what she and her husband did.  For a long time she was on the FBI's most wanted list. Her husband is just as radical as she was. Two of Obamas friends.  He failed to handle the Gulf Oil spill in a timely manner.  Failed to end the war like he promised he would do. Took him three years to end it….hundreds more died on his watch.  Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it came to a vote.  Snubbed the president of Israel. Snubbed Britain by returning that bust of Churchill.    He appointed Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions (without even getting congressional approval) then doing nothing for them after Glenn Beck calls them out…forcing many to resign.  Then there was his failed stimulus…health care the country still does not want…  Wants total amnesty for illegals.  Does not even know basic American geography and thinks there are 57 states.  Thinks that there was only one bomb that hit Pearl Harbor.  He thinks to solve any financial crisis….borrowing is the answer. So he has borrowed until we now don't even have our chins above water.  I could go on and on….  He is a narcissist and his change was not what the people who even voted for him expected he meant. His change seeks to destroy the country. He is absolutely incompetent and dangerous….and I would vote for just about anyone in order to get him out. Well except Nancy Pelosi and I think she is almost worse than Obama is.   If he is get in for four more years…we are doomed. He hates this country and it shows. He has done nothing but apologize for Americas actions since taking office and I think people even many Democrats are sick of him and can now see him for what he is.   Change is good in some cases….thats why we need to throw him out. Maybe then he can go over and listen to the Muslim call to prayer…something he said was the most beautiiful thing he has ever heard.

It seems a lot of people have 'conveniently' forgotten that the Bush administration pretty much sucked the wind out of our nation (and world), with its 'shoot from the hip' policies. TARP money was first brought up by him, and in case your memory is not good, most of the money Bush received could not even be traced. No one seemed to know where it went! His policies began the process of deteriotaton that Obama inherited. By the time Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'. Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with. If you know anything about American politics, you realize, the President's power are limited, and dependent upon Congress. In other words, even if his policies were 'perfect', if Congress decided not to support them, they would go no where.  Perhaps the greatest argument' can be found not just in the political arena, but in the totality of the man. Agree or disagree with his actions, you have to give credit to the fact that he is a man who keeps his promises, and maintains integrity in both his personal and professional life That type of man is more likely to succeed for it takes integrity and committment to accomplsh worthy goals.

""Now, in the short term, we still need to do everything we can to encourage safe and responsible oil production here at home. In fact, last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. So I want everybody to remember that if people ask -- because sometimes I get letters from constituencies saying, why aren’t we just drilling more here? We’re actually producing more oil here than ever. But the challenge is we’ve only got about 2 to 3 percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil.

181,"Those two links don't say that he's lying, they say that he's misrepresenting information... which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack Knoller.   They speak against the validness of the article, and portray good arguments. Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   I'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession, I'm talking about the very necessities of his office. In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.""   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it ""helps"".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most. Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.

184,"Maybe you should. Obama admits that he wants to redistribute wealth.   Which is not socialism.  Have you ever heard of the saying (paraphrased) ""Two rectangles, one is equilateral, the other is not. Both are rectangles but only one is a square.""  Redistributing wealth is a characteristic of socialism, like being a rectangle is a characteristic of a square, but it is not the defining characteristic.   Government sponsored corporations include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac  Federal Government chartered and owned corporations include Florida Virtual School (Florida), National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Tennessee Valley Authority, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Millennium Challenge Corporation, St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps), Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Legal Services Corporation, USPS, AMTRAK, many alcohol retail stores of which 19 states have monopolies, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Federal Government acquired corporations include GM, CITIGROUP, AIG and many others.   Does our state own  all  businesses and corporations? Or, does it own  all  critical utilities?   Not Permanent but Under Nixon and Carter.   Not presently.   Apparently, you should try reading. How about welfare and social security?   So, all the wealth of the top ten percent is divided amongst the bottom 90% evenly?  Redistribution of wealth entails a whole layer of government that controls incomes and aims to prevent people from becoming excessively wealthy to the detriment of others. It isn't as simple as having social programs.

Good thing that that article said that the entire 'comparing debt' idea was stupid, and that they're all as bad as each other.   Even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument, that is not NEARLY the amount that went up in spending under the Obama administration. Unless Corporate welfare counts...   Of course, but the $700 billion spent on stimulus, increased welfare spending, and decreased tax revenue, it would make a big part of the difference.   One that Obama continues, and even expanded by bombing Libya and progressing the disaster in Pakistan.   I haven't personally, but I bet if you compare the costs of conflicts that the two leaders started, you would see a massive difference. However, yes, I agree, Obama's foreign policy is not perfect. Part of why I have repeatedly claimed that he is simply the best of a bad lot.   Which will do practically nothing to cover the costs that he continues to spike. It's a red herring.   43 billion is not a small amount, and yet it is Republicans who continue to block it. This is not Obama's fault.   I was referring to his proposal on Healthcare, not something a decade ago (that actually also led to economic prosperity. If it wasn't for the war, Bush would have a much better legacy in economics).   I agree, I was saying I don't trust him because of what happened a decade ago. And Bush's deregulation (under Ryan's plan) lead to the market crash and the recession we're still in. Yes, the times of prosperity were good, and Bush's, but that doesn't mean it was a good thing overall.

198,"The inevitable demise of the economy was near under the false pretenses of the success of the housing bubble, which was created by the expansion of credit by the Federal Reserve and the Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress.    I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  ""To me, money is fungible,"" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  ""It's a genuine paying back,"" White said. ""It does reduce the federal government's involvement."" Still, he said, ""it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate"" with the U.S. government.

Which is still a good sign.   All of which were created by bad government policy before.   Yeah, like the irresponsible deregulation of the housing and banking markets. When you repeal laws that prevent downright criminal business practices, this can have a detrimental effect. I don't share your faith, the private sector can fail, and history is our proof of this.

He also threw away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts (mainly for the rich), as well as deregulating the banks, causing them to rapidly spiral their risks, into what we now call 'a great big fucking recession'. Considering that he started off with a budget surplus, I hardly consider this a good record.  Then, you look at Obama. He's cut back on military spending, partially through removing troops from around the world (saving lives), as well as through straight cuts. In his first year, spending fell - overall spending growth in 4 years is lower than the inflation rate (0.4%). Obama is spending essentially the same amount as Bush did at the end of his presidency. However, due to a fucked economy, tax revenues have fallen massively, and government non-discretionary spending has risen (due to increased welfare payments).  So no, that's patently wrong. Please learn a little more before spittling off indoctrinated bullshit.

212,"Totally, People need to start thinking in terms of - maximal aggrigate demand. I feel like most right wing economic ideas do not promote maximal aggregate demand and thus I question the right wing economic ideas with respect to their intelligence and justifiability with respect to economic evidence and modern economic theory.   progressive taxation inspires greater consumption from the group that consumes the greatest - The Middle Class. It is the best way to accelerate economic activity. As far as i am aware, Supply side economics (i.e. trickle down economics - right wing economics) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption.   Aggregate Demand is the combination of Consumptions, Investment, Govt. Spending, and Net Trade activity. As far as i know, the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group. The middle class invest and consume relative to their ability. Progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus, in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class (typically left wing, socialistic policies).   To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well. I question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity

214,"Btw, I want your opinion on something. I live in Qatar, which has a large government sector, mostly in banking and petroleum. This generates a massive portion of its GDP, over 60%, and it therefore charges minimum levels of tax. My parents only pay import tax, no VAT, no income tax, and massive subsidies on energy (petrol & electric).  The government spends billions trying to improve the country, ensure long term financial stability, building infrastructure, maintaining culture, and provides its national citizens with the most extensive benefits system in the world (most nationals get about $1 million throughout their life, if they're born today).  Is this government bad?

215,"I agree with those statistics but I don't think we can attribute all of this growth to Obama. I will admit I was quick to say a failing car company is going to fail whether or not we spend billions on them. I was proved wrong. It worked. Obama is clearly against a free market. In my opinion he has great ideas but they are too far fetched. Although he wants to, we can't help everyone! Here is Obama's view  Tuesday, President Barack Obama argued that while a limited government that preserves free markets ""speaks to our rugged individualism"" as Americans, such a system ""doesn't work"" and ""has never worked"" and that Americans must look to a more activist government that taxes more, spends more and regulates more if they want to preserve the middle class.     http://cnsnews.com/news/article/ obama-limited-govt-preserves-free- markets-doesnt-work-it-has-never-worked     Also, and this is not an attack on Obama's stimulus package ( I am here to learn), what jobs did Obama create that wouldn't have been created on their own.

231,"Well, your excused!!  Sure, bankers and unscrupulous speculators and con artists destroyed many jobs indirectly with their risk and irresponsible business decisions, but those jobs were directly lost to fear, inactivity and no confidence in the economy.  However, the real problem is the Federal Reserve, the central bank who provided the money for the bailouts and were supported by the government. If the Fed were to end, sound money would reign supreme and end the influx of inflation and bailouts. If bailouts were not guaranteed by the Fed and the government, these banks would have strong incentives to practice responsibility and prudent business decisions; plus, the government passed laws requiring banks give loans out despite the ability to pay.  The problem with government stepping in or demand side economics boosting investment are 3 factors. One is inflation unless you love inflation, in order to reinvest, more money needs to be printed; thus, it devalues the currency, and it actually hurts the poor and middle class in the long run because wages increases can't keep up. Two is higher taxes. Since the government has very little ownership, they don't own assets. They have to tax to pay for these investments. Three is if no higher taxes, then it is increasing debt, which is just as bad as inflation.  I completely agree that the war machine and corporate welfare is wrong. War can only be funded by unappropriated or levied resources where the government must print more money in order to pay for wars. Corporate welfare simply means no bailouts to failing companies and support those with sound business decisions.

233,"Ah, so you want to go to the beginning of our correspondence?  Very well!   Yes. Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.   Firstly you didn’t distribute your subject, economists. And in response I rationally supposed that you meant  some  economists. For no man in his right mind would make the error of supposing that all economists agree. Furthermore, I even granted you the supposition that you were referring to the consensus opinion of economists concerning employment of 2010.   Secondly, no question I asked you remotely hints at suggesting that all economists are nit-wits. I repeatedly asked questions that implicated  only some  economists, and never could it be rationally asserted that I implicated  all  economists.   If you disagree, then consider the following example.  Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.  A contrary rebuttal: Not all economists expect employment to be back the end of 2010.  Finally, demonstrate to me how any question I posed in my original post implicated all economists; for you certainly responded as though I had.  Moving on…   You refer to conservative ideologues, and then imply they are not rational people.  All US economists are conservative ideologues. Why? Because all US economists want to conserve the free-market capitalism of the US which they believe to be perfect or near perfect. Yet, most economists supported the abandonment of free market principles for the sake of capitalism as a means to conserve capitalism. So, who is rational, the economists who protected their ideological view, or the economists who supported the reign of free-market principles.   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor I can’t believe any person would use the opinion of the same as a premise of an argument. Albeit, the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.    My evidence: Reality! Why? If the track record of economists was as worthy of policy as you assert then the economy of the US would not be so fucked up as it is now. Economic forecasts are intended to preclude the mess that we are currently struggling with.  Shall I drive that point further?  And the reason, I suppose, that my post was up-voted multiple times is because, believe it or not, I spoke of that which they too are witness. And like me, they too have lived long enough to know that an economist predicts so far into the future that most men are not likely to remember the previous forecast of a year ago. Yet, if there are some who do remember, I assure you that the same economists will provide an explanation of why their forecast was wrong.   Shall I continue with the remainder of our correspondence?  (Better to be pissed off than pissed on.)   Oops, I almost forgot!  Don’t ask me (implicitly) to divine the un-employment rate of the US for 2010 as an evidence of why the consensus opinion of economists is wrong!   They were wrong about this year’s rate of un-employment and I have no reason to believe they can foresee next year’s rate.

234,"yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard.   His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.   Less taxing means more debt.   But it is not spending, which actually creates debt. Taxing is unnecessary to continue spending. Government will spend as much as it wants and will tax people as much as they want. We can't just say ""increase taxes to reduce debt"" when the debt could have been avoided all together. Once again, it's a red herring.   it largely falls outside of his mandate   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?  Bill Clinton, however, signed welfare reform. This was a Federal act.   I like this part of them, but disagree with others   yet you're not specific on how their economics will hurt anyone. You've avoided pointing to specific, first saying ""welfare is necessary"" and then saying ""well, Obama has no control over welfare.""  Now, economics may not be your strong suit (it was once something i hardly considered), but if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views, you should be more specific on what is wrong with them.   Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule, even though I already described how the Buffet rule is a ""red herring.""   You wish to completely deregulate the banks?   It's about getting government away from the banks all together. The banks, how they currently operate, could not survive without government involvement. They rely on subsidies, standardized currency, human controlled inflation and regulation to keep themselves in power. Without it they would hold little power over our wealth and currency. Currently, the banks dictate most money powers. They will continue to dictate as long as government stays involved with the affairs of the banks. This isn't about letting the large trample the small, it's about removing the power-source for this monstrosity that government created in the first place. Big government is the problem here, not lack of it.   bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country.   A bank without government would NEED to operate in the interest of the consumers or else it will attract none. Currently people feel that they need banks. While the privatization of banks seemed like a good idea during the transitional period between Centralized and non-centralized banks, what ended up happening was government assisted greedy men. You can not expect the private sector to do what it does best if government is still involved, as it always has been. The banks are protected from competitive currency because they hold all currency rights. The banks are paid by governments to continue being banks, which removes most financial liability (especially when you're large enough to ""need"" a bailout). And the banks are encouraged by leaders (government bureaucrats like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to make poor decisions but given money to make up for those poor decisions. This isn't some magical imbecile who happens to be running a bank, this is a guy basically being given money to make poor decisions with all of our money. It was inevitable with government involvement, as Ron Paul accurately predicted.   Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common,   Not if you eliminate government involvement in the banking market.   I was simply using them as an example.   A terrible one.   I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.   I'm sure you do, people complain a lot. The importance is substance, though.

Socialist policies promote education as well, which can only serve to benefit our economic situation insofar as our nation has become a service-based economy, and our remaining industries are both capital intensive and require at least some post secondary degrees (High tech industries).   Insofar as this is true, Obama, who has an idiologically left (socialistic) alignment, is the best option.

260,"No signing statements to nullify or undermine congressional instructions as enacted into law    Here is Obama's full memo:   Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies     SUBJECT: Presidential Signing Statements     For nearly two centuries, Presidents have issued statements addressing constitutional or other legal questions upon signing bills into law (signing statements). Particularly since omnibus bills have become prevalent, signing statements have often been used to ensure that concerns about the constitutionality of discrete statutory provisions do not require a veto of the entire bill.     In recent years, there has been considerable public discussion and criticism of the use of signing statements to raise constitutional objections to statutory provisions. There is no doubt that the practice of issuing such statements can be abused. Constitutional signing statements should not be used to suggest that the President will disregard statutory requirements on the basis of policy disagreements. At the same time, such signing statements serve a legitimate function in our system, at least when based on well-founded constitutional objections. In appropriately limited circumstances, they represent an exercise of the President's constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and they promote a healthy dialogue between the executive branch and the Congress.     With these considerations in mind and based upon advice of the Department of Justice, I will issue signing statements to address constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means of discharging my constitutional responsibilities. In issuing signing statements, I shall adhere to the following principles:   1.The executive branch will take appropriate and timely steps, whenever practicable, to inform the Congress of its constitutional concerns about pending legislation. Such communication should facilitate the efforts of the executive branch and the Congress to work together to address these concerns during the legislative process, thus minimizing the number of occasions on which I am presented with an enrolled bill that may require a signing statement.   2.Because legislation enacted by the Congress comes with a presumption of constitutionality, I will strive to avoid the conclusion that any part of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional. In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional, I will act with caution and restraint, based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well-founded.   3.To promote transparency and accountability, I will ensure that signing statements identify my constitutional concerns about a statutory provision with sufficient specificity to make clear the nature and basis of the constitutional objection.   4.I will announce in signing statements that I will construe a statutory provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that construction is a legitimate one.  To ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed only when consistent with these principles, executive branch departments and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the Attorney General before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to comply with, any provision of a statute.  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.   Here is a list of Obama's signing statements:   http://www.coherentbabble.com/ listBHOall.htm    which one(s) do not comport with the above?

261,"No matter what happens with Obama's policies, the Republicans have moved too far to the right to produce a candidate with moderate appeal. While the Republican nominee used to be decided with a lot of input from party elites, the far right talk shows have taken over the party since Obama's election. Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh will not allow moderates like Giuliani or Huckabee, or even traditional Republicans like Gingrich to become the Republican nominee. Instead, far right ""heroes"" such as Palin will dominate the nomination process. These candidates will inevitably run poor campaigns that focus on false and trite attacks that the electorate is no longer as vulnerable to due to the widespread internet and decline of a single, easily influenced mass media. However, the Republicans will give a strong convention that will make people wonder if Obama is vulnerable, until a disastrous performance in the debates eliminates whatever hope they had. Thereafter, the Republican campaign will devolve into infighting and will run out of money due to the poor management skills of its leadership, which will cause all but approximately 40% of electorate, representing essentially tea-baggers, loyal republicans, and mistake voters, to turn against them. Obama will then win by a clear margin.

We tend to blame him for not trying his best to embetter the economy but what we are failing to understand is the fact that this is his first term in office and the economy is not something you can fix in a second, it is a critical aspect that requires careful thought, planning, analysis and actions which can take several years. It is also through President Obama and his supporters that the health care bill, legislation to curb green house gases and improve the environment passes, preventing a second great depression by saving three large car manufacturers from going out of business and which would have possibly leave hundreds or thousands without jobs, and also passed the largest economic stimulus bill, bringing the war in Iraq to an end, thus saving the economy a lot of money and innocent lives from being taken, nuclear non-proliferation movement, repairing our image abroad, reversed George Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign organizations that allows abortion, lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell research, implementation of education system reform, tobacco regulation, financial industry reformation, appointing two Supreme Court Justices.

I am going to vote for him again in the coming election because he is our best chance and has done a good job thus far - just look at the job growth - the sluggishness of the markets and this effect on job growth and economic prosperity has nothing to do with him and his efficacy as a president - the conditions of our economic environment both domestically and internationally are the biggest influence in our slow recovery   Insofar as the economy goes, Bush didnt cause the collapse, but he did increase the national debt for these two not fully thought out wars (which we havent really won even though we have made some significant positive changes in the region).

304,"Maybe this will be viewed as a hateful comment but it definitely not intended that way, i hope Obama isnt re-elected, i hope some nutball right winger like Palin gets elected cause then the world will be forced to sit and take notice of americas hanus actions, as im sure foreign policy (and atrocities) will only increase under the tenure of some gun toting republican.

306,"Federal regulation of health care should be limited and focused  For example, individuals who are continuously covered for a specified period of time should not be denied access to insurance because of pre-existing conditions.  individuals should be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines, free from costly state benefit requirements.  Finally, individuals and small businesses should be allowed to form purchasing pools to lower insurance costs and improve choice.  Regulation can correct common failures in insurance markets, but it is often counterproductive.  Regulation places a burden on good portions of the economy, not just bad portions.  Regulations function as a hidden tax. The federal government’s own Small Business Administration placing the price tag of regulation at $1.75 trillion annually—much higher than the entire burden of individual and corporate income taxes combined.  federal agencies today have near plenary power to issue whatever regulations they see fit. Though most are nominally controlled by the president, in actual practice agencies are frequently able to act autonomously with little or no presidential oversight. The end result is an economy subject to the whims of unaccountable bureaucrats pursuing their own agendas. A new regulation can suddenly transform a profitable investment into an unprofitable one or render employees unproductive. This produces uncertainty with all its attendant economic ills.  Just because we have the worst portions of the market, and the worst portions of socialism in American healthcare, does not mean we need to go towards more socialism... These countries that you hold up as models, are more efficient than ours, but they are going away from generous social programs, because they are going broke...  You point out that these other countries are more efficient, but Obamacare increases the paperwork, and decreases efficiency. How does Obamacare improve things?

310,"Obama is a liberal black socialist and the media will not speak against him because they cater to the blacks.He wants this country to be a welfare state.The black vote will go his way because they would rather get things for free than to WORK!These people are a scourge on society and I wish they would quit reproducing their filth.I'm tired of paying to raise them!

311,"I tire of people who scream bloody murder over 'socialism' when neither the president nor anyone else in congress has passed or introduced any legislation which even remotely resembles socialism as it exists in self-described socialist nations. It polemical rhetoric at it's finest. Using people's fears of socialism to mold the political climate is deceptive and grossly misinformed.

314,"Try studying what socialism is. To put it simply, Obama is not socialist because socialism requires state ownership and control of businesses, wage control, and control of wealth distribution.   Maybe you should.  Obama  admits that he wants to redistribute wealth.   State ownership and control of businesses:   Government sponsored corporations include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac  Federal Government chartered and owned corporations include Florida Virtual School (Florida), National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Tennessee Valley Authority, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Millennium Challenge Corporation, St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps), Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Legal Services Corporation, USPS, AMTRAK, many alcohol retail stores of which 19 states have monopolies, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Federal Government acquired corporations include GM, CITIGROUP, AIG and many others.   Wage Control   Not Permanent but Under Nixon and Carter.   Control of wealth distribution   Apparently, you should try reading. How about welfare and social security?

315,"Why did Obama lead the Federaql Government to shut down Arizonaq , and they were only trying to do what the Federal Government is supposed to do by protecting our borders, Why do States allow Illegals Drivers Licenses, I would think that would be Harboring a Criminal,, lots of questions to be asked, Obama( Numb nuts) wants more Government control, they want to rule every aspect of your life.
